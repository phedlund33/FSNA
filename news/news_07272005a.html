Dear ___________: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We want you to know from an on-the-ground perspective what is&nbsp; <br>
happening in our neighborhood right now. As you can see in the&nbsp; <br>
accompanying real estate advertisement and keyed tax map, our Fry's&nbsp; <br>
Spring community is under siege. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One, the 188-unit Cherry Avenue PUD will be breaking ground in&nbsp; <br>
the next few months. While it has passed through a series of board&nbsp; <br>
reviews, no serious public consideration has been given to its impact&nbsp; <br>
on the water, traffic, pedestrian safety, or quality of life for the&nbsp; <br>
existing residents. If you review the minutes, you will see that&nbsp; <br>
concerted community objections were disregarded by the planning&nbsp; <br>
commission. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two, a large parcel at the end of Hill Street that encompasses&nbsp; <br>
the ravine between Hill and Shamrock Avenue, was recently sold to&nbsp; <br>
Thomas Hickman, the developer of the Stribling Avenue site. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three, a&nbsp; property at 212 Raymond Avenue is being marketed with&nbsp; <br>
an open invitation to developers. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four, the Jefferson Park Avenue railroad bridge will be closed&nbsp; <br>
for reconstruction. Traffic in and out of our neighborhood will be&nbsp; <br>
seriously disrupted. Current plans also call for the permanent&nbsp; <br>
closing of Todd Avenue, which can only aggravate congestion, impede&nbsp; <br>
police, ambulances and fire engines, and imperil those who live here. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fry's Spring is marketed and exploited as convenient to UVA. We&nbsp; <br>
are not extended the protections of designated University neighborhoods. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our taxes pay the salary of a full-time director of Neighborhood&nbsp; <br>
Development Services, who shepherds developers' projects through the&nbsp; <br>
city's approval process. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who on the City Council, on the Zoning Boards or Planning&nbsp; <br>
Commission, speaks up for those of us who live here? <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it make sense to implement planning by driving up real&nbsp; <br>
estate assessments and driving out current residents? We pay for&nbsp; <br>
those profits realized by the seller, and by the developer, in taxes&nbsp; <br>
and in quality of life. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this what is meant by the “Master Plan?” If so, it is failing&nbsp; <br>
us. Just look at the traffic that doesn't flow, and ask where all the&nbsp; <br>
new vehicles that accompany your in-fill developments are going. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When will you come to Fry's Spring, and see for yourself? <br>
<br>
Sincerely yours, <br>
<br>
Andrea K and Laurance Wieder <br>
