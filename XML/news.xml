City Hall<br />
Charlottesville, VA  22902<br /><br />

The Fry's Spring Neighborhood Association fully supports Council's resolution of September 20, 2010, modifying the local Water Supply Plan. We particularly support Council's resolve to dredge the South Fork Rivanna Reservoir, to limit raising the height of the Ragged Mountain Reservoir Dam to 13 feet unless a need is proven for additional height, and to continue your efforts to obtain reliable cost elements for all the various components of the Plan.<br /><br />

Your dedicated attention to this issue is a great service to our City.

Respectfully,
<br /><br />

From: Peter Hedlund, President, Fry's Spring Neighborhood Association<br />
Date: May 13, 2010<br />
Re.: Neighborhood-located City Council meetings<br />
<br />
<br />
On Wednesday, May 6, 2010 at the quarterly Fry's Spring Neighborhood Association Board Meeting the board discussed the idea of City Council meetings taking place away from City Hall throughout city neighborhoods.  We unanimously voted to oppose this idea.  We believe tax money should not be spent on such a venture.  We believe that the City's best interests are served by having a central and predictable place for every City Council meeting.  However, we do support the idea of City Councilors attending neighborhood meetings alone or in pairs regularly throughout the year.

		<headline><![CDATA[FSNA Letter Sent to City Council Regarding Delays in Funding Old Lynchburg Road Improvements]]></headline>
			<summary><![CDATA[<p>On April 3rd the following letter was sent to Charlottesville City Councilors.  On April 5th the letter was read by Jeanne Chase at the City Council meeting:<br /><br />
			To: Charlottesville City Council<br />
Cc.: Craig Brown<br />
From: Peter Hedlund, President, Fry's Spring Neighborhood Association<br />
Date: April 3, 2010<br />
Re.: Old Lynchburg Road Project<br />
<br /><br />
Cars still speed on Old Lynchburg Road.  Pedestrians still walk up and down Old Lynchburg Road without sidewalks.  After a heavy rain polluted storm water still flows unabated into Moore's Creek.  These are all reasons that the Safety, Sidewalks and Drainage project on Old Lynchburg Road must stay on track.   <br /><br />

The City Manager has been quoted as saying that "There's an impression in the community that this project is just going to start."  We don't think that's an accurate assessment.  There was an expectation - set by the City - that this was a project with two distinct phases.  And that one phase would lead to the next.  
<br /><br />

The first phase is Design. This was supposed to have been completed last Summer, now we are told by City Staff that it won't be completed until next January. <br /><br />

The second phase is Construction.  Your decision as a Council to allocate money is what decides this phase.  As you weigh your priorities for Charlottesville we ask you to consider the long overdue benefits this project would bring: <br /><br />
<ul>
	<li>Safety for pedestrians and bicyclists.  Now that the plans for the redesign of Azalea Park are nearing completion, it seems especially important to allow for safe access to this City Park.</li>
	<li>Abatement of the environmental catastrophe that occurs each time it rains and the oily and sediment-filled runoff flows down into Moore's Creek.</li>
	<li>Peace of mind for area citizens that live and or drive along Old Lynchburg Road.</li>
	<li>Satisfaction and validation to the many citizens who in good faith attended multiple planning meetings at the behest of the City to make this project a reality.  By delaying the funding for this project you are telling them that they have wasted their time.</li>
	</ul>
	Finally, I think some thought needs to be given to the way Capital Improvement Projects are conceived. It does the community a disservice to have so much time separating the design and construction phases of projects.   By the time construction begins on this project there will have been turnover in the affected part of the neighborhood and undoubtedly a need to bring those new residents up to speed and get their buy-in on the project.  This will be costly and time consuming.  (The J.P.A. bridge replacement project is an example of the costs associated with project delays).<br /><br />
	
	 would urge you to put money back in the upcoming budget so that the project's construction phase won't be delayed.<br /><br />

This project was overdue five years ago.

			<summary><![CDATA[<p>It is the opinion of the FSNA Board that citizens should be involved in the selection of the next Charlottesville City Manager.  This position was communicated to City Council  prior to the March 1st City Council meeting.  The following email was sent to the City Attorney and City Council:<br /><br />
			To: Charlottesville City Council<br />
Cc.: Craig Brown<br />
From: Peter Hedlund, President, Fry's Spring Neighborhood Association<br />
Date: February 22, 2010<br />
Re.: Citizen Representation on City Manager Hiring Committee<br />
<br /><br />
The members of the Board of the Fry's Spring Neighborhood Association unanimously urge the City Council to include Charlottesville City residents in the hiring process for Charlottesville's next City Manager.   This is a critical position that greatly affects the responsiveness of the City staff toward the citizens of Charlottesville.  <br /><br />

Please update us on the process and time line for hiring the next City Manager.  Also, please forward to us the job description, salary information and the text of the job listing.<br /><br />

We look forward to a transparent and citizen-involved process as the City moves forward with this very important hire.

			<summary><![CDATA[<p>
			On February 16th the FSNA board was made aware of a <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0Af8rE9MdGP2aZDdxZDRzZ182NDBmYzltZGtqOA&hl=en" target="_blank">report</a> that was going to be presented to City Council at the February 17th City Council meeting.  The report was in response to several Councilors' interest in establishing a new City position of "Neighborhood Advocate".  This statement was read by FSNA board member Andrea Wieder at that meeting:  <br/><br/>
			To: Charlottesville City Council<br />
			From: Peter Hedlund, President, Fry’s Spring Neighborhood Association<br />
			Read into the public record by Andrea K. Wieder<br />
			Re: Neighborhood Advocacy<br />
<br /><br />
			Charlottesville City Council:<br /><br />

I am here representing the Board of the Fry's Spring Neighborhood Association and would like to address the topic of "neighborhood advocacy" on tonight's agenda.  Because of the short notice given to us regarding the discussion of this issue - one day - we were unable to discuss this important subject with the full neighborhood association which meets only once a month.   Instead, members of the FSNA board exchanged emails yesterday and today trying to figure out if a member of the FSNA could even attend tonight's meeting.  <br /><br />

We are reserving our ultimate judgment on this issue until more details have been fleshed-out and we have been able to discuss the pros and cons at a full meeting of the Fry's Spring Neighborhood Association.<br /><br />

We appreciate that the City Council is considering ways to strengthen the relationship between the City and the neighborhoods, however adding another layer of bureaucracy and another salary to the city payroll is not the way to accomplish this.  A City the size of Charlottesville should not need more employees to be responsive, respectful and efficient in its relationship with its citizens.  And indeed our experience has been often positive in dealing with many of Charlottesville's city staff and you the City Council.  However, at other times City staff fail to return emails, City employees drag their feet when legitimate requests are made and do not  provide adequate notice about important public meetings.<br /><br />

It is our belief that respect, thoughtfulness and responsiveness are qualities that as taxpayers we deserve from our City government.  We also believe that these expectations should be impressed upon City staff from both you as our elected representatives and from the City Manager's office.  <br /><br />

In keeping with council's efforts to forge a more informed relationship with the community, we request that there be at least three citizen representatives on the committee that evaluates candidates for the the City Manager's soon-to-be-vacated office.  Please feel free to call upon the Fry's Spring Neighborhood Association in putting together that committee.

			<summary><![CDATA[<p>In the spring when the JPA Bridge is closed for replacement the traffic will undoubtedly increase on Shamrock Road.  This will have a negative impact on the pedestrians and bicyclists trying to cross the railroad tracks.  This concern was expressed at the September FSNA meeting by Johsnon Village neighbor John Shepherd.  He is trying to impress upon the City the importance of making improvements to that railroad crossing and has formed a <a href="http://docs.google.com/View?id=d7qd4sg_570dwkkgxv2" target="_blank">petition and an outline</a> of the issues.

		<headline><![CDATA[Letter From Neighborhood Development Planner Ebony Walden Related to Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Ordinance Under Consideration]]></headline>
		
		
		
		<summary><![CDATA[<p>
In an effort to create more affordable housing options for city residents and encourage temporary housing for those who are at risk of being homeless, the City Council has directed the Planning Commission to draft an ordinance that allows for Single Room Occupancy (SRO) facilities in Charlottesville. The Commission has asked staff to inform neighborhoods about this process/ordinance.</p>
<p>
SRO facilities are small permanent apartments for very low income persons. SRO facilities are not temporary homeless shelters, but permanent housing for persons who are in danger of being homeless or formally homeless. This ordinance being reviewed is NOT for a specific facility – meaning, we do not have an application to locate a facility in Charlottesville. We are drafting an amendment to our Zoning Ordinance that would define and regulate SRO facilities in Charlottesville and indicate which zoning districts these facilities would be allowed in (a map of those districts is attached). The current draft (attached) would allow these facilities basically anywhere apartment buildings would be allowed (in multi-family, commercial and mixed use areas, not single family residential districts), because they are essentially efficiency units for a specific income bracket that provide services.</p>
<p>
Any resident in the SRO would be likely be from Charlottesville or potentially other localities in the region that we share homelessness funding/programming with. Persons in these facilities would be screened and would have to pay rent. Any other impacts would be mitigated as a part of a Special Use Permit process. An application for an SRO would require a public hearing and allow for citizen input. Part of the proposal is that these facilities be allowed only by Special Use, so that each one can be reviewed on a case by case basis for its appropriateness and the Planning Commission can place conditions on the facility that might mitigate the impacts. The ordinance draft calls for additional regulations to manage the impact of these facilities including requiring on site services, on-site management as well as the City being able to review their operational plans, so the operations of such facilities would not negatively impact the surrounding neighborhoods. Staff has researched the location of these facilities in other VA localities (Richmond, VA Beach & Norfolk) and they have all worked well and have no impacts. SRO facilities are a great means of providing permanent housing and services to single adults that need affordable housing.</p>
<p>
I hope this answer some of your questions. Please read the documents (initial staff memo to the Planning Commission and draft ordinance) in the following the link, as I think they are helpful in understanding the issues: <a href="http://www.charlottesville.org/Index.aspx?page=2522" target="_blank">http://www.charlottesville.org/Index.aspx?page=2522</a></p>
<p>
Also attached a brief overview of SRO facilities and following is a link to other such facilities that have been built in VA. Go to the Virginia Supportive housing website (<a href="http://www.virginiasupportivehousing.org/residences/cloverleaf-apartments.php" target="_blank">http://www.virginiasupportivehousing.org/residences/cloverleaf-apartments.php</a>) and review supportive studio apartments.</p>
<p>
This item will be discussed at next months Planning Commission meeting on June 9th. Please call me if you have questions. If you want to submit comments in writing you can send them to me directly as soon as possible or before June 9th and I will make sure they are forwarded to the Commission. I am in the process of completing my final staff report on this matter and this will be available on our website next week.</p>]]></summary>

		<headline><![CDATA[FSNA Supports the City Council in Asking for a Narrower JPA Bridge]]></headline>



		<summary><![CDATA[<p>At the September 2nd, City Council meeting FSNA President Peter Hedlund read the following statement: <br/><br/>



		As President of the Frys Spring Neighborhood Association, I wish to express the Association's concern over VDOTs proposed Jefferson Park Avenue bridge design.



<br /><br />



The FSNA appreciates being kept abreast of bridge developments by NDS staff and appreciates City staffs receptivity both to an altered ADA ramp design and to a shift in turn-around placement. The neighborhood also wishes to acknowledge the support received from City Council in the past as we have sought to narrow the bridge design.



<br /><br />



In April of 2007 the City formally requested that the proposed bridge width be reduced from 80 ft. to no greater than 60 ft. This request was received and acknowledged by VDOT.



<br /><br />



After studying the recently proposed bridge plan, we ask that Council reiterate its request that the bridge be kept to 60 ft. or under. The current proposal shows a bridge width of 67 ft. with excess space dispersed in primarily three areas of the bridge width.



<br /><br />



We ask that the on-street parking proposed on the south west approach to the bridge be removed. By removing the parking lane feeding into the southern side of the bridge and by consolidating the remaining width to accommodate only necessary bike, pedestrian and traffic lanes, the bridge width could be reduced by more than ten percent.



<br /><br />



By removing the parking lane and using all the remaining width, the bridge will require one less building module of 7 1/2 ft. Cost of materials will diminish. Removal of the specified parking lane would not interfere with the current alignment of the proposed bridge abutments.



<br /><br />



Council should already have received <a href="http://fsna-bucket01.s3.amazonaws.com/0808VDOT_FSNA.pdf">drawings</a> of both the current VDOT proposal and an FSNA proposal which falls within Council's 60 ft. ideal.



<br /><br />



In conclusion, we hope that this crumbling neighborhood bridge is replaced as quickly as possible.  We just hope that the main factor driving its design is safety.



<br /><br />



Thank you for your attention to our concerns about the bridge and your dedication to serving Charlottesvilles interests.

		<p>Joe Mooney's letter to the Daily Prgress in response to the article:  <br />Mr. Thomas Frederick, Director of the Rivanna Water and Sewer Authority, asserts that dredging of the South Fork Rivanna Reservoir "...has already been thoroughly studied." (Daily Progress, Feb. 3, 2008, pp. A2-3) In fact, the only study of dredging the Reservoir was performed in 2004 by Gannett Fleming Inc., a firm specializing in dam and pipeline building, and with no experience or expertise in dredging. Does Mr Frederick really feel it is responsible to make a decision involving over one hundred million County and City dollars based entirely on the recommendation of a firm with no experience in such a project. County and City officials should encourage him to reconsider his position.</p>

		<summary><![CDATA[November 6, 2007  <br />







Ms. Jeannette Janiczek <br />



VDOT Program Manager  <br />







Neighborhood Development Services<br /><br />







City Hall<br />







P.O. Box 911<br />







Charlottesville, VA 22902 <br />







RE: JPA Bridge and Todd Ave. <br />







Dear Janiczek, <br /><br />







      I am following up on the meeting held in the NDS conference room on the 13th of September 2007.  At this meeting Michael Petrus and I presented a sketch of our vision of the closed end of Todd Avenue, a visual we hope the City and VDOT will strive toward as the JPA bridge replacement project progresses.   <br /><br />







      At the meeting Ms. Tucker requested that we take our <a href="https://share.adobe.com/adc/document.do?docid=61e8b73d-7983-11dc-b75f-151d3f6d9313" target="_blank">sketch</a> to the Frys Spring Neighborhood, that we verify that the neighborhood supports this general concept before VDOT explores the feasibility of aspects of our proposal. <br /><br />







      I am pleased to report that our renderings were presented at the annual Oktoberfest gathering of Frys Spring neighbors.  Attendees were able to view and discuss the Todd Avenue proposal we already discussed with you.  The response from residents was positive and, at the October 10, 2007 meeting of the Frys Spring Neighborhood Association, the body voted unanimously that the FSNA endorse the neighbors sketch proposal of the closed end of Todd Ave. <br /><br />







      Now that we have sought and obtained the backing of the FSNA, we ask that the City and VDOT pursue inquiries into the feasibility of our proposal and that the product of these inquiries be made available to us in a timely manner. <br /><br />







Sincerely, <br /><br />



 







Adrienne A. Dent  <br /><br />



 <br /><br />

		<headline><![CDATA[Representatives from Fry's Spring attended Eastern Connector meetings]]></headline>



		<summary><![CDATA[Hardy Whitten's report:<p>On Tuesday, May 22, I attended the Public Information Meeting for the Albemarle County Community Development Eastern Connector Corridor Study.  Juandeigo Wade and a representative from PBS&J, an engineering firm, presented and reviewed the Presentation on the website.  The <a href="http://www.albemarle.org/department.asp?department=planning&relpage=9606" target="_blank">link</a>  provides a great deal of information, but the most thorough point that I felt was made was that this is a Study, not a Project.</p>



		<p>



The study area is roughly bounded by US 29 North, Proffit Rd., Route 20, and Route 250.  An assumption that was stated by Juandiego is that the southern most portion of the Meadowcreek Parkway is to be built from Route 250 to Rio Rd.  Another goal of the study was to identify travel routes throughout the study area to improve and manage traffic volumes for the Countys growth.  Study will continue through 2007 with plans developing around the end of the year.  A review of the plans will take place until early 2008, with actual recommendations from the Study group for the County being available in sometime early 2008.</p>]]></summary>

Who will step up to the leadership role on council to bring closure to the intersection safety at Cleveland, Willard, and Cherry which has been promised, but not as yet fulfilled: two additional stop signs, improved signage to show pedestrian crossing and better crosswalks? </p>



<p>II.  Who will show leadership to get the necessary infrastructure in place to supply and sustain the current community as well as the swelling developments: roads, water, and sewer to name three? </p>



<p>III.  Who will show leadership to move monies to the Fontaine-Sunset Connector to get it built as fast as the Leonard Sandridge Parkway at UVA? </p>



<p>IV.  What reality help is forthcoming from the county and the university to work with reinforcing the established neighborhoods in the city rather than using and abusing and leaving?</p>



<p>V.  Can the proximity to Route 64 be more effectively utilized by the county to move county traffic around the city and not through existing neighborhoods? </p>



<p>VI.  Who will step up in a leadership role to call for a Summitt of city, county and university leaders to come up with a comprehensive plan before a crisis occurs involving the high volume of traffic, the high density of development, the water source to sustain, and the needed sewer lines that will take the additional volume of need? </p>



<p>VII.  Who in the city government is the neighborhood advocate? </p>



<p>VIII.  What is happening to the $$$ that will be saved by narrowing the JPA bridge?  What has happened to the $$$ from Cherry Hill that is earmarked for the improvement of the Cherry/Willard/Cleveland intersection?  What has happened to the CIP funds for the &ldquo;Safety, Sidewalks, and Drainage&rdquo; work promised for OLR?</p>]]></summary>

		<summary><![CDATA[   The following are some brief notes compiled.<br />



   <br />



   County  Planning commission will hold a public hearing related to traffic and  the Granger property on March 15th.&nbsp; The county estimates the connector  road will cost $12.8 million.&nbsp; It is unclear how much of that will be  paid for by the developer.&nbsp; One hurdle is that the county has yet to  accept the Area B study into it's comprehensive plan. <br />



   <br />



   According  to University architect David Neuman the University is still commited  to extending Stadium Road to Fontaine Avenue which would align with the  proposed Sunset/Fontaine connector.&nbsp; This would potentially alleviate  traffic on Fontaine Ave. which is currently graded an &quot;E&quot; on Level of  Service (&quot;F&quot; is the worst).<br />



   <br />



 The next PACC meeting is May 17th in the City Hall basement conference room.</p>



 <p>The <a href="http://cvilletomorrow.typepad.com/charlottesville_tomorrow_/2007/02/pacc_2007q1.html" target="_blank">Charlottesville Tomorrow site</a> has a complete audio recording of the meeting and more comprehensive notes.</p>]]></summary>

		<summary><![CDATA[<p>To the Fry's Spring Neighbors: </p>



<p>Thank you for attending last night's City Council meeting and continuing to be vigilant and offering the support necessary to preserve our unique neighborhood.  It is gratifying to have neighbors who are willing to speak out not once but many, many times, on the traffic, safety and development issues faced by our neighborhood. </p>



<p>During the past two years the issues confronting the Fry's Spring neighborhood have escalated in number and intensity (as you all know from our well attended neighborhood meetings) but thanks to your determination and perseverance we have seen results such as the initiation of traffic calming on Robertson/Highland, the removal of the &quot;thumb&quot; at Cherry/Cleveland/Willard (CCW), the drainage and safety needs being addressed on OLR and the reconsideration of the width of the JPA bridge. </p>



<p>Neighbors are are also actively monitoring the development at Huntley and Cherry Hill, the reconfiguration of the CCW intersection, the JPA bridge and the onslaught of development south of Fry's Spring.  I encourage everyone in the neighborhood to continue to speak out on the issues we face and to bring your thoughts and concerns to the the Neighborhood Association. While we may not always see immediate results, if we continue the conversations, we will eventually see results. </p>



<p>Again, my personal thanks for you dedication to our neighborhood. </p>



<p>John Santoski, President Fry's Spring Neighborhood Association </p>]]></summary>

		<summary><![CDATA[John Pfaltz is coordinating a meeting to look at traffic problems in the city. He writes: "Many of us have been watching the traffic situation



in the city gradually deteriorate throughout the city,



and dramatically so in some neighborhoods.







    On Wednesday, Jan 17, next week we are gathering as



many people from as many neighborhoods to try to 



create a picture of just what the traffic situation



is across the city.  We will meet at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Cherry+Avenue+Christian+Church,+Charlottesville,+VA&ie=UTF8&om=1&z=14&ll=38.033355,-78.479891&spn=0.047729,0.080338&iwloc=A" target="_blank">Cherry Avenue Christian Church</a> at 7PM.  If you can come we would welcome you.  If not, but there are others in your neighborhood who are interested in traffic issues, please extend our invitation to them.







    Our goal will be only to map out the hot spots



in the city and determine just how bad (or how good)



is the traffic on various streets.







    Please forward this invitation as widely as possible.  We hope to



have every area represented with at least one or two individuals."]]></summary>

		<summary><![CDATA[Citizens interested in Charlottesville's environment should attend a free community workshop at the Charlottesville Design Center on Wednesday Nov. 15th from 6-8 p.m. Residents are invited to come learn about the condition and plans for city streams, trees, trails, and also green building. The workshop is sponsored by students at the University of Virginia, the Charlottesville Community Design Center and the City of Charlottesville. Students will present results from a review of city environmental assets and seek citizen input on actions and strategies designed to improve the habitat and quality of life for people and animals. Community input will be used to refine the draft chapter, which will then be presented to the City Planning Commission for review and to City Council for adoption as part of the update for the City's Comprehensive Plan. The Design Center is located on the downtown mall at 101 E. Main St., Charlottesville, VA, 434.984.2232 <www.cvilledesign.org>]]></summary>
