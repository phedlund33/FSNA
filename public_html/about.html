  <p><strong>Where  are the regular  meetings held?</strong><br />
  The  meetings for FSNA are held on the second Wednesday of every month at  the Cherry Avenue Christian Church on Cherry Avenue in  Charlottesville. The meetings begin promptly at 6 p.m. and are over  at 7:30 p.m. </p>
  <p><strong>How  are the regular meetings run?</strong><br />
  An  agenda for each meeting is posted to the FSNA web site  (http://avenue.org/fsna/) a week or so in advance.&nbsp; Copies of the  agenda are also sent via email to members for whom we have email  addresses.</p>
  <p> At  the start of each meeting, times for the items on the agenda are  assigned and, should there be additional items added to the agenda,  they are also assigned times.</p>
  <p> Meetings  are open to all. The meetings are recorded, and posted, along with a  written guide, to the FSNA web site.</p>
