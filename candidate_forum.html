<p> <span class="regularText">John Santoski, Neighborhood Association President, will give a short<br />
  introduction and will act as moderator. Each candidate should then give a<br />
  three minute over-view of themselves and their candidacy. We ask that each<br />
  then have prepared a ten minute presentation focused on the following:</span></p>
<p> <span class="regularText">&quot;We are concerned about the overwhelming growth suddenly being planned<br />
  south of our neighborhood in Albemarle County. Traffic through the<br />
  neighborhood is already at a level where further increases will pose<br />
  critical safety and congestion problems, as well as create noise, air<br />
  quality, and general environmental quality of life concerns. What do you<br />
  understand of this issue, and what do you propose to support protection of<br />
  our neighborhood?&quot;</span></p>
<p class="regularText"> Any time remaining will allow questions at random from the floor to one<br />
  or all candidates. Because of time constraints, answers should be limited<br />
  to one minute or less.</p>
