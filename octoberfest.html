    <br />
  Issues raised by Oktoberfest 2007 attendees:<br />
  </h2>
  <span class="front_page_art">Why do we have more mosquitoes than other city neighborhoods?<br />
    <br />
    County development affecting traffic - speed, volume, cut thrus<br />
    <br />
    Too many rentals - absentee landlords ** property not kept up, noise, too many cars per house.<br />
    <br />
    Traffic!&nbsp; Where is the 4-way stop at Cherry, Willard and 2 Clevelands?<br />
    <br />
    Enforcement of existing traffic, noise, shooting laws<br />
    <br />
    Dominion Power has left (after installing new power lines) our sidewalks <u>unwalkable</u> - chunk/piles of rock &amp; mud around each pole - I've complained to  the city &amp; the company, to no avail!!! Very dangerous for  pedestrians/strollers/wheelchairs that have to go in the road.  (Crestmont Ave) <u>Sidewalk access in general.<br />
    <br />
    </u>Light and sidewalks for pedestrians &amp; bicyclists<br />
    <br />
    Who even builds neighborhoods without sidewalks?&nbsp; <br />
    <br />
    Sidewalks to/from Azalea Park<br />
    <br />
    Bike Lane/sidewalk on Old Lynchburg Road<br />
    <br />
    Bright reflective sign in front of Fry's Spring Beach Club so car doesn't crash into stone wall driving on JPA<br />
    <br />
    Streetlights on Monte Vista Avenue<br />
    <br />
    Broken bottles and excessive trash around Jackson-Via Elmentary</span><br />

  <h2>Issues raised by Oktoberfest 2006 attendees: </h2>
	<p class="front_page_art">Excessive speeding - Harris Rd. &amp; 400 block of Moseley Dr. </p>
	<p><span class="front_page_art">  Sidewalk on Stribling Ave. 1. Very narrow - not enough room for a pedestrian + 2 cars to pass, 2. Many blind curves + Hills, 3. Many people walking to bus stop at JPA, LG. Population on Road 4. Plenty of room on both sides of st. in front lawns for sidewalk </span></p>
    <p><span class="front_page_art">  There is no sidewalk on the S/W side of J.P.A. around FSBC. There should at least be a crosswalk for switching to the N/E side. </span></p>
    <p><span class="front_page_art">  Sidewalk continuity throughout - would love it if the city would put together a long-term plan to put utility wiring underground - our trees are suffering! </span></p>
    <p><span class="front_page_art"> *Would like enforcement of leash laws for dogs.&nbsp; Two bull terriers almost attach me and my little shi-tsu dog and I had to yell at the owner to call his dogs back immediately - NOW! </span></p>
    <p><span class="front_page_art">  Please, I second this! It is very difficult to walk my dog, who although is always is on a leash, does not like other dogs in his face, and is not able to avoid them when they run up. </span></p>
    <p><span class="front_page_art"> Also need stop light at Cherry Ave. &amp;&nbsp; JPA </span></p>
    <p><span class="front_page_art"> Please consider speed bumps on Monte Vista Ave. and throughout Fry's Spring.&nbsp; And I love the idea of sidewalks everywhere.&nbsp; Monte Vista is increasingly experiencing speeding - the street narrows to one lane it's rather dangerous. </span></p>
