The workshop is sponsored by   students at the University of   Virginia, the Charlottesville Community Design Center   and the City of Charlottesville. Students will present results   from a review of city environmental assets and seek citizen input on actions and   strategies designed to improve the habitat and quality of life for people and   animals. Community input will be used to refine the draft chapter, which will   then be presented to the City Planning Commission for review and to City Council   for adoption as part of the update for the City's Comprehensive Plan. The   Design   Center is located on the   downtown mall at   101 E.

          <p><strong class="menuSubItem">5/1/2006</strong> - <span class="regularText">A group of neighbors attended a &quot;walk-about&quot; of the Huntley property. Below is the message from Paul Beyer explaining the regrading issue:</span></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="menuSubItem">To the Fry Springs Neighborhood Association,</p>
            <p class="menuSubItem">This is Paul Beyer with R.L. Beyer Construction, one of the developers of the Huntley subdivision. I attended the last Fry Springs Neighborhood meeting on Wednesday April, 12th to discuss a proposed re-grading amendment in Huntley. As Jeanne Chase has already informed you, in that meeting we agreed to have a walk-a-bout of the area in question to discuss the amendment and our proposals in more depth. <br>
                <br>
                That meeting is today, Thursday, April 27, at 5:30 PM.  We will meet on Huntley Avenue where the gravel ends, or roughly in front of the old Dymond House. There is ample parking along the road. The developers of Huntley, Rick Beyer &amp; Tom Hickman, as well as Ashley Cooper from NDS will be in attendence. <br>
                <br>
                For those unable to attend, permit me to briefly describe the amendment. There exist steep slopes on a section of Huntley which will necessitate the building of large retaining walls. We feel that such large retaining walls (in places 25' high) will not be advantageous to our customers or the Fry Springs Neighborhood at large. Our proposal is to remove dirt from the hillside and lessen the slopes. This will, however, require the removal of 12 trees from that hillside which were previously protected in the &quot;approximate clearing limits.&quot; While this is unfortunate, we feel the retaining walls are not a pleasant alternative. <br>
                <br>
              Currently, this proposal is still in the preliminary stages now at the City. If it is approved by the city engineers, it will go before the Fry Springs community at large in a public hearing with the Planning Commission and City Council. <br>
              <br>
              I believe today's walk-about is very important in keeping all the neighbors fully informed. I encourage all those who have concerns about this regrading or Huntley in general to please attend.</p>
            <p class="menuSubItem">Thank you, </p>
            <p class="menuSubItem">Paul Beyer</p>

          <DIV class="menuSubItem">The original Hickman/Beyer purchase of 20 acres, plus   Huntley Hall and about 3 acres with it, which I came to known from city records   as the Huntley PUD now is divided into three parts, as follows:<br>
            <br>
          </DIV>

          <DIV class="menuSubItem"><strong>Huntley Avenue</strong></DIV>
          <DIV class="menuSubItem">The first part, called Huntley Avenue, is being built   by RL Beyer Construction Company. Of the five lots listed today in the Beyer   area here is the summary:</DIV>
          <DIV class="menuSubItem">Lot 1/no price shown/Sold</DIV>

          </DIV>
          <DIV class="menuSubItem">There are many. many more lots, all with no houses on   them, in this part of the development. The lots hug a tightly curving pattern   that twists around, doubling back on itself, and exits onto Sunset.&nbsp;</DIV>
          <DIV class="menuSubItem"><BR>
          </DIV>

          <DIV class="menuSubItem"><strong>Morgan Court</strong></DIV>
          <DIV class="menuSubItem">The second development is called Morgan Court and is   being built by Gaffney Homes LLC. There are, today, no homes built in this area   which is just behind Huntley Hall. Prices and floor plans for these homes are   coming and both developments are being marketed by Pace Real Estate Associates,   LLC. Phone 434 817 7223.</DIV>
          <DIV class="menuSubItem"><BR>
          </DIV>
          <DIV class="menuSubItem">The Morgan Court homes are to be built on a long   cul-de-sac road that curves upward. This road is already built. There will be 35   houses in this one section and the lots are numbered L1-L35.</DIV>
          <DIV class="menuSubItem"><BR>
          </DIV>
          <DIV class="menuSubItem">The grade on which these houses will be built is very   steep. So steep in fact that many of these homes may have garages underneath   them (according to one RE person on site today). It is on this steep slope that   I saw the most changes in the landscape - trees that had been standing, now   down, roots exposed, earth-moving equipment all around. This was not&nbsp; as it was   on Sunday April 16, when I walked through the development and saw a worker on   site.</DIV>
          <DIV class="menuSubItem"><BR>

              Don&rsquo;t worry, say   developers, more roads coming to fill the need</p>
            <p class="regularText">As Hunter Craig and his investors continue the delicate   process of shepherding the huge Biscuit Run development south of town through   the County&rsquo;s red tape, one of the biggest concerns of the skeptical public is   what the project means for traffic.</p>
            <p class="regularText">Craig&rsquo;s lawyer, Steven Blaine, says a traffic study now   underway will help developers estimate the impact of Biscuit Run. Not only that,   the study will be so broad, it&rsquo;s likely to be of use to the County and other   jurisdictions, he claims.</p>
            <p class="regularText">Funded by the developer at a cost Blaine pegs at &ldquo;six   figures,&rdquo; the study, conducted by Ramey Kemp and Associates and the Timmons   Group, will take traffic counts from 34 intersections around the development. In   addition, it will project future traffic using computer models. State and County   engineers will review the results. The County Planning Commission has scheduled   a work session for April 18 to address Biscuit Run&rsquo;s traffic issues, but Blaine   says the study will probably not be ready by then.</p>
            <p class="regularText">To ease people&rsquo;s concerns, Blaine points to the County&rsquo;s   &ldquo;Southern Urban Area B&rdquo; Study, which contains optimistic forecasts for new roads   in fast-growing southern Albemarle (If you&rsquo;re having trouble sleeping, check it   out at www.albemarle.org).</p>
            <p class="regularText">Other roads are planned for the area near Biscuit Run,   including a privately developed road linking Fifth Street Extended and Avon   Street north of I-64. A &ldquo;Southern Parkway&rdquo; is planned to link those same roads   south of the Interstate. Also, County plans call for another road that will   connect Sunset Road with Fontaine Avenue, designed to ease pressure on Old   Lynchburg Road between Fifth Street Extended and Jefferson Park Avenue. As   development mushrooms in southern Albemarle, the question of whether the   cash-strapped State transportation department will actually be able to build   those roads anytime soon is sure to make locals nervous.<em>&mdash;John Borgmeyer</em></p>

The following are her notes from the meeting: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="menuSubItem">At about nine p.m. the Planning board took up the matter of the PUD.<br>
              Planner Barton said it was a mistake that the board did not include a second access road when they first approved the site plan.<br>
              Plannner O'Halloran said the reason that there was no second access road was because Johnson Village did not want one.<br>
              Planner Lewis wanted to know why the board could not review this now and consider another road to correct their mistake.<br>
              Chair/Planner Firehock asked the lawyer at the back of the room to come forward and speak to the question about the second access road.<br>
              Lawyer (Kelly? I did not catch the name) said since they didn't add the road then they can't re-open the matter and do it now.<br>
              Planner Barton said that many matters about this project were in the lowest common denominator.<br>
              Ashley Cooper walked the planners through all the proffers of this project and other details of the project.<br>
              The developer of this project, KG Associates was present and was asked a few questions about drainage and trees.<br>
              Cherry Hill LLC will have 23 single family homes and 94 townhouses.<br>
              Despite some talk among board members that they did not yet have the platts (sp?) for this subdivision and so they could not vote on it Mr. Tolbert read from the Code Book that they could vote on it.<br>
              They did. The Planning Board passed on this review of the site without a single no vote. Not once single dissenting vote.<br>
              Their vote was described as &quot;ministerial&quot;.<br>
              The mintues for this meeting will be posted online, as are all meeting minutes for the city of Cville. All can read them.<br>
              The notes I took may not jibe with what is recorded. It is hard to tell what is said sometimes .  But I am quite certain of what I heard and who said it.            </p>
            <p class="menuSubItem">But regarding the Tongue, listed by Ashley Cooper as one of KG's proffers, Mr. Tolbert said on the record that he was prepared to tear up the Tongue if that is what the community wants.</p>
            </blockquote>
          <p class="menuSubItem">A.K. Wieder introduced the following letter at the beginning of the meeting:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="menuSubItem"> Let the public record show these three points of concern about the   Cherry<BR>
               Ave. PUD:<BR>
               1/&nbsp; The Cherry Avenue PUD has only one access   road. There needs to be a<BR>
               second access road. All the traffic associated   with this project will come<BR>
               out onto Cherry Avenue. Our community raised   this sticking point in the<BR>
               original public hearings on this project, and   we have not been heard. Let<BR>
               us be heard now: we want the planning   commission and the city council to<BR>
               reconsider this matter. We request   that the development have a second<BR>
               access road, as noted in the Frys'   Spring Comprehensive Plan 2006.
              <BR>
              <BR>
               2/ Proffers associated   with this project include the Tongue, a<BR>
               protuberance of newly poured   sidewalk that juts out into the<BR>
               Willard/Harris/Cleveland intersection.&nbsp;   This eyesore, built&nbsp; without input<BR>
               from the community, has made a   dangerous intersection more so. The Tongue<BR>
               interferes with pedestrians,   parking, traffic and worship at the Cherry<BR>
               Avenue Christian Church The   church elders have had to chain off their<BR>
               parking lot because folks now   drive through the lot to avoid the<BR>
               intersection. Trying to cross any of   the streets in this intersection is<BR>
               taking your life in your hands. Our   meetings with city staff have not yet<BR>
               resolved this problem. We hope to   do so. The Tongue was built with proffer<BR>
               money from this developer. We   all want it removed.
              <BR>
              <BR>
               3/ Development in our city has   pushed assessments way up in just one year.<BR>
               City Council doesn't even   have to raise the tax rate to get more dough<BR>
               from us because of the high   assessments. Housing that developers are<BR>
               building and selling fuel these   hikes borne by those of us already living<BR>
               here. The very least THIS   developer can do is add another road out of his<BR>
               project. That way   existing neighborhoods can connect to new neighborhoods<BR>
               and beyond   instead of serving as extended driveways for developers'<BR>
                 enclaves.
              <BR>
              <BR>
               I urge the Planning Commission to take this   site plan back and along with<BR>
               City Council add the second access road to   the Cherry Ave. PUD.&nbsp; It is the<BR>
               right thing to do, the fair thing, and a   simple enough request considering<BR>
               that ground has not yet been broken on   this project.
              <BR>
              <BR>
               I have seen that City Council can amend   zoning changes to preserve and<BR>
               protect other neighborhoods in this city.   Please amend the Cherry Ave. PUD<BR>
               to help us preserve and protect our   neighborhood.
              <BR>
              <BR>

               letter and my   remarks.<BR>

          <blockquote>
            <DIV><span class="menuSubItem">Dear OLR Residents,<BR>
                  <BR>
              I enjoyed meeting with you all on Saturday and   appreciate the time that you have put into improving the situation in your   neighborhood. I'd like to make sure that we are all on the same page with   respect to followup:<BR>
              <BR>
              Traffic calming - I think that everyone was   interested in the proposal to neck the traffic down at several points as a way   of calming traffic. I'll admit to being a little nervous about how well it work   for traffic to take turns going though a one lane passage, although it seems to   work OK for the one lane bridge on Proffit Rd, where the traffic counts are   similar.&nbsp; Jim, can you give us an idea of when NDS would have some preliminary   concept plans to show the neighborhood?<BR>
              <BR>
              Traffic avoidance - ultimately   the only way to reduce traffic on OLR is to construct the "alternative 4"   recommendation from the Area B study. This is the version shown on the map that   I brought. The complete study includes current traffic counts (about 4300 cars   per day on OLR) and projected counts (could drop to 2500 cars per day or   increase to 5000 cars per day depending on the alternative selected). The latest   version of the Area B study that I am aware is from September 2004 and can be   found at: <BR>
              <A href="/exchweb/bin/redir.asp?URL=http://www.albemarle.org/department.asp?department=planning%26relpage=5618" target="_blank">http://www.albemarle.org/department.asp?department=planning&amp;relpage=5618</A><BR>
              In   the latest version of the Granger tract development plan that I have (Nov 2005),   it appears that the developer is proposing to use the dirt portion of Stribling   Ave instead of the Area B recommended alignment. I understand from Jim that   since then, the developer has agreed to move forward with something that is very   close to the Area B recommendation, although I dont have any documentation of   this anywhere. Jim, if you have any more recent documentation on either the   Granger tract proposal or Area B recommendations, I would appreciate it you   could share these with myself and the neighborhood. The exact alignment of the   development road is likely to have a big impact on Fry's Spring neighborhood. <BR>
              <BR>
              sidewalk - I can see that a sidewalk is very much needed here, although   it looks like it would be fairly expensive to construct. It appears that to be   feasible, it would have to be on the same side of the street as the beach club.   I did not realize until being told at the meeting that the beach club fence was   on City right of way. I think in the immediate term we should require the beach   club to fix this - as it is, there is only a couple of feet between the fence   and the road, which is not very safe for walking. If the fence was set back a   few more feet, then at least there would be a safe pedestrian path from JPA into   the neighborhood, even if it takes a while to get the sidewalk built. Jim, can   you get us a map that shows how much the beach club fence intrudes into the City   right of way as well as the width of City right of way going alongside of OLR   from JPA to Middleton? <BR>
              <BR>
              I'm sorry I missed the discussion on drainage.   The impression I got from the handout is that the water wants to naturally drain   on the same side of the road as the beach club, which could possibly create   complications with putting a sidewalk there. I dont know if this was   discussed.<BR>
              <BR>
              There may be additional followup items from the part of the   meeting that I missed. I would like to suggest that after we hear back from Jim   on the latest Area B and Granger info, that we may want to schedule a followup   meeting and also invite Lindsey Dorrier and County Planning Commission members   to discuss the recommended Area B alt 4 design. <BR>

              They were taken in November, 2005, on the last football gameday here in Charlottesville.<br>
                <br>
              I took them and send them to you now in an effort to show you and city council that plans to close Todd Avenue permanently when the JPA railroad bridge is re-built will create a very dangerous situation for us in this tiny corner of the Frys' Spring neighborhood.<br>
                <br>
              Placing a cursor on each image with provide information on location and point of view.<br>
              I have many more pictures for your reference and would be happy to discuss this in tandem with a fire/emergency vehicle review.<br>
              This matter has been raised with VDOT at the Dec. 15, 2005 meeting to no avail.<br>
                <br>
              Hill Street is a dead end street.<br>
              Center Street is a dead end street.<br>
              How many more dead ends can this tiny area take?<br>
              Many thanks for your attention to this matter,<br>
